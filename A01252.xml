         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For who ought to haue more intereſt in comfort, than the comforters? And what fitter patrones of comfort can a man imagin to find than the authors &amp; fathers thereof? For this cauſe therefore haue I made choiſe of your Worſhips, and of your brethren beloued in the Lord, as of all men moſt meet to commit theſe my writings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And this the rather haue I done, as on the one ſide in regard of my ſelfe, to whom there is nothing more deare, or more due, than to recompence ſpiritual for temporall things: that you which haue ſowne temporall, might (if there be any in mee) receiue from mee ſpirituall comforts: that thus you ſeeing a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt of your corne, fruit of your labor, comforts to ſpring of your comfort, &amp; mercies of your mercies, that is, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the treaſures of the mercies of God, opened vnto you, for the mercifull

I therefore haue laboured (it lieth in you, that I may ſay) I hope not in vaine, that you might alſo abound with ſpirituall and inward comforts.

Moreouer know this, if thou mean not to ſurceaſe to ſin, that the promiſes of grace, &amp; benefits of Christ appertaines not vnto thee.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>s there is no eſtate, either in bodie or ſoule, more dangerous, or more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, than that which is deſperate. ſo there is no ſpeech, either more lamentable or leſſe true, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which commeth therefrom: which (in effect) is, either the ſame that came from <hi>Cain,</hi> that crieth out, that his ſins are greater than can bee forgiuen, or that which came from <hi>Ieremie,</hi> inferred as it were vpon the former, that concludeth, that there is no hope left for him in the lord. Wherein, albeit they ſpeake according to the ſight of their ſinnes, that ſeem to be monſtrous, and therefore vnpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: or according to the feeling of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14132:13"/> wrath of God, which ſeemeth vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, &amp; therfore intollerable: yet not according to the verie truth it ſelfe. For it is not to bee denied, but that the blood of Chriſt, which is that price wherwith they were redeemed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſins, far excelleth the value of all ſinne whatſoeuer in the ſight of God: &amp; that the holy ghoſt, which is that ſanctifying ſpirit, that waſheth vs from all our ſins, being God, &amp; therfore of infinit power, is able to clenſe vs, and wipe away, as all teares from our eies, ſo all ſins from our ſoule: &amp; to make thoſe offences, that are as the skarlet (that is, the moſt bloody, as the skarlet is moſtred) to be like vnto the ſnow: and them that are as the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be like vnto the wooll. For the Lord is rich in mercie to all them that call vpon him faithfully, and abundant in kindnes. And therfore as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth: <hi>there is mercy with him that he may be feared: and with the Lord there is plenteous redemption.</hi> It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore, that howſoeuer it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not vnto that ſoule: yet there is hope of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort left vnto him, &amp; ſo to all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that come vnto the father, by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. For euen God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14132:13"/> is called by the ſpirit, the God of all comfort, and the Father of all mercy &amp; conſolation: and Ieſus Chriſt is that fountaine of gardens (as the ſpouſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him) in whom all fulnes, yea, euen of the comforts of God, dwelleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure: and the ſpirit of God is called by Chriſt himſelf the comforter. So that we being by the ſpirit, which is the comforter, lead, through Chriſt the fountaine of the gardens of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Lord, vnto God the father, the father of all comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how is it poſsible that wee ſhould want either comfort or ſpirituall conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? Aske them that haue been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore as thy ſelfe afflicted, &amp; therfore, for the preſent, as thy ſelfe perſwaded: aske them I ſay, whether (though they ſpake according to their preſent fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,) yet, whether they ſpake according to the words of truth, yea, or no. They can tell thee, and that, both out of the word, and by experience, that although ſorrow lodge with thee for a night, yet ioy ſhall come in the morning: that they are al bleſſed that now weep, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice: that they are bleſſed that mourne, for they ſhall be comforted: that a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14132:14"/> &amp; contrite hart, is a ſacrifice ſweet ſmelling vnto God the Father, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: and that both this thy ſorrow, which is for thy ſins, if it be ſo great, as that it breed repentance, and ſo little, as that it breed not deſpaire, is that godly ſorow, which is a notable grace of God, and a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vertue (created in thee by the ſpirit) conſiſting between two extreames, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire on the one ſide, and ſenceleſneſſe on the other ſide: and alſo, that euen this thine (as it ſeemeth) ſeruile feare, is that ſpirit of bondage to feare, which is mentioned in the eight to the Romans. That is, that fruit of the ſpirit of God, wrought in thee, to bring thee to the true feare of God, which is, as the holy Ghoſt beareth witneſſe, the verie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and offſpring of wiſdome. And that therefore this ſorrow, and feare, are but thoſe foundations or ground workes, vpon the which, the ſpirit of God (whoſe worke-manſhip now thou art in Ieſus Chriſt) will build the other graces of God, euen ſanctification (that is, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes &amp; true holines, the fruit wherof, as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> telleth vs, is ſowne in peace) &amp; ſpirituall comfort, with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14132:14"/> fulnes of God and of the holy Ghoſt, which being once felt after thy ſorrow, will make thee ſing a Pſalme of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vnto the Lord and make thee to reioyce with ioy vnſpeakable. For the end of godly ſorrow, is ioy in the ſpirit, &amp; comfort in the holy ghoſt. After <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> teares enſued the fulnes of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Dauid</hi> that in one place complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that his ſinnes are continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and gone ouer his head, as a burden too heauy for him to beare: in another Pſalme addreſſeth himſelfe to ſing of the mercie and iuſtice of the Lord: and to extoll his long patience, &amp; louing kindnes. The Iewes, that by the preaching of <hi>Peter</hi> were pricked in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, were afterward by the ſame <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> baptiſed to the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſins The Iaylor that had drawne out his ſword to kill himſelfe withall, was after comforted by <hi>Paule,</hi> and reioyced, that he with his whole houſhold beleeued in God. And to conclude, what one man hath there euer ben, that rightly ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſins, that hath not found his ſorrow to be turned into ioy, and his mourning into comfort? Comfort thy ſelfe therefore with their comforts, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14132:15"/> ſo make thy ſelfe partaker of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Knowing this, that the Lord, that hath giuen thee wine to glad thy heart, oile to make thee haue a cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſweete flowers to delight thy ſences, muſicke to refreſh thy mind, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to ſpeake in a word, manifold comforts for thy body: is, as rich in the comforts of the ſpirit, which he will as richly in his time appointed, ſhed into thy heart by the holy Ghoſt: the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wherof may be a good ſtep to the attaining of that ſpiritual comfort, that thou deſireſt and thirſteſt after. For to a ſicke man, it is euen health it ſelfe to know that his diſeaſe is curable, &amp; that there is remedie inough for the ſame. But as it is not ynough to know that there is a ſalue for his ſore, except hee know the confection, and the ſame be applyed: ſo in this diſeaſe of the ſoule, I meane deſpaire, it is not ſufficient to know that there is a remedie, except the ſame be applyed accordingly. The one which is to apply the remedie, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the worke of the grace of God, and to thine owne care, and deſire of peace, and eaſe. The other, which is to deſcribe the comfort, I will (by the grace
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14132:15"/> of God) labour in. And herein I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe thoſe particulars onely; which my ſelfe know to haue been profitable vnto others, that haue been, as thou art, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14132:16"/> Scriptures moſt euidently, &amp; plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the moſt part, in euery one of the Prophets, afford. As namely in the 18. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where the Lord expreſſely promiſeth, that if the wicked will return from his ſinnes that hee hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and keepe all his ſtatutes, and do the thing that is lawfull and right: that he ſhall ſurely liue, and ſhall not die: and that all his tranſgreſsions that hee hath committed, ſhal not be mentioned vnto him: but in his righteouſneſſe that he hath done, he ſhall liue. And againe in his 33 Chapter, the Lord by the mouth of the ſame Prophet promiſeth, that if the wicked turn from his ſinne, none of his ſinnes that he hath committed, ſhall euermore be mentioned vnto him. And this is that alſo which is promiſed by the Lord (by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> in his 33 chap.) to all them that repent, who promiſeth, that he will cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe them from all their iniquities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſinned againſt him, yea, that he will pardon al their iniquities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue ſinned againſt him, and wherby they haue rebelled againſt him. And this is yet further confirmed by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> who in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14132:16"/> 43. chapter, bringeth in the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeaking after the ſame maner, and ſaying: <hi>I, euen I am he, that putteth away thine iniquitie, for mine owne ſake, and will not remembe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All which it ſhall bee needleſſe to repeat. Theſe few, in ſtead of all the reſt, may ſuffice to ſhew vnto thee, that the Lord hath paſſed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to paſſe by thy ſins, and to forgiue thine offences &amp; traſgreſſions. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, may be a ſtrong and infallible comfort vnto thy conſcience. Knowing that the Lord, that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is able, by reaſon of his power (to whome it only appertaineth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue ſins) &amp; is willing, by reaſon of his promiſe to performe it. For we are not to ſet the Lord before our eyes, ae thoſe vaine men of the world, that promiſe more than they are able to accompliſh.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14132:17"/> or as thoſe deceitfull men, which being in the ballance, are lighter than vanitie it ſelfe, who make a face, but haue no heart, make an offer, but haue no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to performe that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. For who hath euer put his truſt in the Lord, and went away confounded? Who hath euer relyed vppon the Lord, and the Lord lied vpon him? Who hath euer depended vpon him, &amp; did not by experience find, that it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put any confidence in man? yea, that it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put any confidence in Princes? With whom did the Lord euer make a couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; broke it? To whom did the Lord euer make a promiſe, and fulfilled it not? Call to mind all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God made in former times, &amp; in the ages that are paſt; and ſee if euer he failed in any one iote of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. He promiſed to giue vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſon, and by him a ſeed, that ſhould be multiplyed as the ſtarres, &amp; as the ſand by the ſea ſhore. How hard a matter was this, and in reaſon impoſſible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? For if wee conſider either the body of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was dead, he being almoſt an hundred yeares old: or rhe

And therefore howſoeuer <hi>Abraham</hi> being ſtronge in faith, ſtaggered not through vnbeleefe at the promiſes of God, but laughed for ioy: yet <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again, he promiſed vnto the ſame <hi>Abraham,</hi> to giue vnto his ſeed after him the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for their poſſeſſion. Now doe but conſider with thy ſelfe how many lets there might haue ſeemed, to haue hindered this that was promiſed. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe had no poſſeſſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at all (as <hi>Stephen</hi> mentioneth) no not the bredth of a foot: his ſeede conſiſted

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14132:19"/> muſt be tempted by Sathan, deſpiſed of men, tormented of God: he muſt bee whipped and ſcorned, yea, hee muſt bee hanged vpon the croſſe, and die a moſt ſhamefull death: he muſt be made ſinne, &amp; the curſe of God for vs: he much deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into hell, and haue the portion of the reprobate and damned ſoule, for to redeeme vs. All theſe might haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the father to haue pitied, and ſo to haue ſpared his onely ſon: eſpecially, they might haue moued God not ſo to haue abaſed himſelfe, but to haue continued in his owne glory and bleſſednes. But moſt eſpecially might that prayer, that Chriſt the ſonne of God made to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the garden, where hee intreated him in the bitternes of his ſoule, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue if it were poſſible, that cup away from him, that is, that he might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thoſe tormentes, and ſuffer that death, together with the contempt and infidelitie of the Iewes, haue cauſed the father, either for his ſonnes requeſt, or the peoples deſert, to haue repented him, and ſo to haue changed his promiſe with his purpoſe. But neither the regard of Gods owne glorie, in his ſon, nor the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing, nor the abuſing, nor the miſerie,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14132:19"/> nor the torments, nor the curſe, nor the death, no nor the damnation (as it were) I meane the portion of the damned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vnto his ſon, nor yet his intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor mans infidelity could bring that to paſſe. What ſhould I ſtand in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the promiſe of God made to <hi>Noah,</hi> which was no more to deſtroy the world with water: although no doubt the ſins ſince the flood, haue ouerpaſſed all that euer went before? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Dauid,</hi> which was, that he would giue him the kingdome of Iſraell, which he brought to paſſe: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the might, the malice, &amp; the rage of <hi>Saule.</hi> The promiſe that he made to the Iewes concerning their returne out of the captiuitie of Babilon: which when they ſaw effected, they were, as it wete one that dreamed, and their mouth was filled with laughter. What ſhall I need to repeat euery one? when it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that neuer a one euer failed or came to naught. Let theſe ſuffice to aſſure thee, that, that Lord whoſe promiſes haue bin euer, euen as himſelfe, immutable, and vnchangeable, notwithſtanding all lets and hinderances: will not now begin with thee, either by reaſon of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſnes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14132:20"/> or multitude, or manner of thy ſinnes, or weakeneſſe of thy faith, to breake his promiſes, and to retaine thy ſinnes, which he promiſed to forgiue. I do not denie, but that thy ſinnes might be monſtrous, and many, yea, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious alſo: and therfore they might ſeeme to bee great reaſons to ſtay the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of theſe forenamed promiſes: but if thou compare them with thoſe mountaines which the Lord ouerpaſſed, and thoſe lets, which yet could not let the performance of his promiſes, they will be little or none at all. Why ſhould that God that neuer was found to haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his promiſe, be, by thee accounted a truce-breaker? And how canſt thou thinke, that, that God that will reuenge with flaming fire, and eternall reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the face of his glorie, &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his preſence, all deceitfulneſſe in man, ſuffer the ſame to remaine, and dwell in his owne perſon.</p>
               <p>Adde herevnto, that theſe promiſes of mercy are deliuered vnto thee in the word of God: the truth whereof is ſuch, as that, as Chriſt teſtifieth, heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, but not one iot nor title of his word. And for this cauſe hath the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14132:20"/> ſpirit giuen vnto the word moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous titles, calling it ſometime the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed of God, becauſe it neuer dieth: ſometimes incorruptible, becauſe it neuer fadeth: ſometimes the guiles milke, becauſe it neuer deceiueth: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the word of truth: becauſe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lyeth. Sometime he compareth it to ſiluer, that hath been tried ſeuen times in the furnace, that is without all droſſe; ſometime to gold and precious ſtones, built vpon the foundation Ieſus Chriſt, which when the fire commeth, that ſhall trie euerie mans worke, ſhall abide, and ſhall not periſh. Sometimes he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it with the continuance and firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the heauens, and the earth, and preferreth it before all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the eternitie, truth, and conſtancy therof. And therfore doth not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeake in vaine, or vntruely of the word of God, when he frameth, as it were a whole Booke, I meane the hundreth and nineteene Pſalme for the moſt part in the extolling and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of God, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For this cauſe is <hi>Eſay</hi> bold to preach that which the Lord commandeth him to publiſh concerning the truth of this his way, ſaying, all fleſh is graſſe, and all the beautie therof, as the flower of the field: the graſſe withereth, &amp; the flower fadeth away, but the word of God indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer.

So that now theſe promiſes being contained and made part of the word of God, are alſo immortall, incorruptible, guiles, true, yea the truth it ſelfe; firmer than the heauens, and the earth, more pure than fined gold, and vnchaungeable, as the holy Ghoſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For an oath, as the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Apoſtle teſtifieth, is with the Lord an immutable thing, that is, ſuch a thing as cannot bee changed. The heauens as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, ſhall waxe old, and as a garment will the Lord chaunge them. The Sunne ſhall looſe her light, and the Moone ſhall bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into blood, before the great and fearefull day of the Lord. The Hils ſhall remooue, the foundations of the earth ſhall ſhake. The earth it ſelfe ſhall periſh with the works that are therein: but the promiſes of the lord eſtabliſhed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14132:25"/> by his oath, are immortall, and cannot be changed. Vntill therefore thou ſee the earth conſumed, and the elements melt with feruent heat; nay, though, &amp; when, thou ſeeſt theſe things diſſolued, yet know, that the oath of the Lord is exceeding conſtant, &amp; that there is no end, nor change thereof. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable. Nay, as the ſame Apoſtle far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame place addeth, it is ſuch a thing as it is impoſſible, that the Lord ſhould lye therein. So that that Lord, to whom al things els are poſſible, who can by his word, at one inſtant, create all things, make things that are ſeene, of thoſe things that doe not appeare: giue life vnto the dead: and againe with a word conſume all thinges whatſoeuer. That God, I ſay, to whom all things els are poſſible, euen to him this one thing is impoſſible: which is to lye againſt his oath. And therefore if it ſhall come into thy minde, that it may be that the Lord will not do as he promiſeth, know for a certaintie that it may not, no, nor cannot be, that the Lord ſhould breake his promiſe, or his oath. It is in poſſible for him, hee cannot doe it. It is ſuch a thing as is immutable, wherin it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14132:26"/> that the Lord ſhould lie The oath therfore of the Lord ſhould bring an end to thy fear, and to thy doubting.

For euen as in the kings broad ſeale, there is imprinted, ingrauen, and ſo repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the perſon of his maieſtie: ſo in this Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, which is his ſeale, is imprinted, in grauen, and ſo repreſented the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y repreſented in his broad ſeale, as the perſon of the Son of God is repreſented in his broad ſeale. Secondly, thou art to know, that therein alſo is his ſeale of armes ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For therin is ſhewed forth the arms of Chriſt nailed to the croſſe (which is the cogniſance of a true Chriſtian) his bodie broken, and his bloud ſhed, for the remiſſion of thy ſinnes. And this is in ſuch a liuely maner, by the breaking of the bread, which is his bodie, and the ſhedding of the wine, which is his bloud ſhewed forth vnto the eies of our body; as that we there behold viſibly as in a mirror, Chriſt crucified before our eies: his body broken, and his bloud ſhed, for the forgiueneſſe of our ſins. So that our eies may there ſee the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption fulfilled, &amp; ſo with all his ſeale of armes, his armes being ſpread vpon the croſſe, and his bodie wounded for our tranſgreſſions. So that euen as the

For it hath been alwaies the vſe of the Lord, to ſeale theſe and ſuch like coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of ſpirituall graces, by the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood. As may appear in the 15 of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where the Lord confirming and ſealing his couenant of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (which repreſented that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ieruſalem vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So the Lord in the 17 of <hi>Geneſis</hi> being to enter into a new couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning the child of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſealed the ſame with circumciſion, which was a Sacrament of blood. But moſt liuely of all this appeareth in the 24 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where the Lord being to

                  </gap>ſt, which is that old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with the Iewes, in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Mediator of the old Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, cauſed diuers beaſts to be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and their bloods to be taken in two veſſels, acco ding to the two perſons: that is, God, and the Iewes with whom the Couenant was to be made: and the blood to be ſprinkled vpon the pillars, erected for that purpoſe, the one repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Lord, the other, the people, which being accordingly performed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> he added ſaying; <hi>This is the blood of that couenant, which the Lord hath made with you.</hi> That is to ſay, this blood is that blood, by the which the Lord ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto you the couenant, that before hee co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enanted with you. Thus as the Lord ſealed his old couenants with the blood of bullocks, goats, and rammes, which were but tipes of Chriſt, the body of all the ſhadowes: So he ſealed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his vſuall maner, this his Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the new couenant in like maner, with blood: and that with the blood of his only begotten ſonne. And the reaſon why the Lord after this manner ſealed his couenants, was this; for that vnto thoſe people, a will, or a teſtament, and a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14132:32"/> couenant, were all of one nature. And therefore the Apoſtle to the Hebrues, &amp; the ſpirit of God in diuers places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, comprehendeth them both vnder one name or word, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: which ſignifieth either a will or teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; alſo a couenant. Now we know that a teſtament or wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l, and ſo a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is neuer ratified vntill the death of the teſtator: that is the man that made the will: but he being once dead, the will cannot be altered, but muſt ſtand vnchangeably. For a man that is dead, cannot alter his will or couenant. The Lord therefore being immortall, and therefore could not die: that he might by the ſame vnchangeable manner, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and confirme his promiſes, cauſed certaine beaſts, which repreſented his bodie as tipes and figures of himſelfe, to be ſlaine for him, and in his ſtead: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that Chriſt himſelfe, who was aboue all things, God bleſſed for euermore, ſhould in his owne perſon by his owne death, and the ſhedding of his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud, eſtab iſh and confirme this his owne good will and teſtament, that is, this new couenant afore mentioned. And thereby ſeale ſinnes, and purge ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14132:33"/> &amp; ſo bring in euerlaſting peace: as the Angell ſpeaketh to <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his ninth Chapter. Chriſt therefore by his death and bloodſhedding, hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed this new couenant of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our ſinnes, in ſuch ſort, as that it cannot be changed. For the man being dead, as the Apoſtle ſheweth to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, the wil is not to be altered. God therfore that he might aſſure vs, that he would not alter this his good will &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace, laid downe his owne life: and ſo by his death, which was by the ſhedding of his blood, hee hath ſo ſealed this his couenant, as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken, nor diſanulled. And as hereby, hee hath inuincibly confirmed his couenants: ſo hath he herein, vſed no other ſeale to ſeale them withall, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which hath been alwayes vſuall in the like caſes. For as all his former coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants (eſpecially the old couenant) were confirmed by blood: ſo likewiſe is this his Indenture ſealed, and ſo ratified by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as before I ſaid, verie fitly called the blood of the new couenant, for that thereby this couenant is ratified, ſealed &amp; vnchangeably confirmed. Thus then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14132:33"/> thou haſt the Lords Indenture, written with his owne hand, and ſealed with his owne blood: which is that broad ſeale, and that ſeale of Armes, that is vſually affixed vnto ſuch couenants &amp; eſcripts. And herein, leaſt thou ſhouldeſt thinke that this ſeale were a counterfeit, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſtealth; thou art to know, that the inſtitution of this ſeale, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, came not from man, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himſelfe, who the ſame night that hee was betraied, ordained the ſame, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it to be ioyned, and added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of grace, and the preaching of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, as infinit proofes might be alleaged, if it were a mater of any doubt. The truth therfore and the lawfulnes of the ſeale, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all doubt and controuerſie. What is there els then, that thou requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for the confirmation of this his, or rather thine euidence? Deſireſt thou witneſſe? Behold the teſtimonie of all the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were the pen-men and writers hereof: who therfore ought to ſtand for double wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Behold the witnes of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of all the faithfull of God, who with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14132:34"/> one mouth, as afterward in part ſhall appeare, do confeſſe the ſame. But what ſhalt thou need to bee carefull hereof, when thou mayeſt bee aſſured, that the lord, if thou ſhew him his own writings and ſcriptures, will neuer deny his owne hand.

That is, that he receiued circumciſion, which was an outward and an euident ſign, to confirme vnto him his free iuſtification by faith.

And therefore the Lord ſhut vp all vnder vnbeleefe, as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth in his epiſtle to the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he might haue mercie vpon all: and ſo by that meanes made away for his mercy, which elſe could not ſo euidently haue mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it ſelfe vnto our vnderſtanding: Herein therefore appeared the depth of the riches, both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God (ſo much admired of <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place) in that he would rather haue man fall, than his mercie faile: he would rather haue man ceaſe to be righteous, than himſelfe ceaſe to be mercifull: he would rather haue man ceaſe to ſhew obedience, than himſelfe ceaſe to ſhew mercie: hee would that man ſhould ſin, that he might appeare to be a gracious God, in the forgiuing of his ſin.

But the Lord not contented therewith, as a ſufficient manifeſtation of his mercie, thought it not ynough to create, except he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create man; to giue life, except he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed life; to giue life to them that were not, except he gaue life to them that were dead; to make man righteous of nothing, except he made him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of a ſinner; to giue him righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, except he did alſo forgiue him his vnrighteouſneſſe, his diſobedience, and ſinne committed againſt his glorious maieſtie.

And as the fire giueth thee heat, and is not moued, as the ſun giueth thee light, and is not vexed, and troubled therewith, fith it is his nature ſo to do: ſo the Lord forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

And that alſo in ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, as that either he muſt forgiue vs our offences, according to his word, or els wee muſt account him vnfaithfull in the breach of his promiſes, or els, which were horrible to think or iudge him to be, an hypocrite, or a diſſembler, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending one thing, and intending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or elſe inconſtant in altering that which he hath ſpoken with his lips, he muſt be thoght (which were mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous) to be vniuſt, in lying againſt his truth.

               <p>Secondly, the Lord hath already pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Ieſus Chriſt for our offences, &amp; therefore cannot in iuſtice puniſh them in vs alſo. For as <hi>Eſay</hi> teſtifieth in his 73 chapter, hee was puniſhed for our ſins,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14132:48"/> he was broken for our iniquitie: we all erred as a ſheepe, euerie one of vs tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his own way, and the Lord made the puniſhment of vs all to fall vppon him. What could be ſpoken more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the proofe hereof, than this which the Prophet he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by the ſpirite of God deliuereth vnto vs? For we offended, &amp; Chriſt was puniſhed; the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Lord, &amp; the father beat his ſon for it: dealing herein with vs, as hee did with <hi>Dauid. Dauid</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted adulterie, and the child that was borne in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, died for it. <hi>Dauid</hi> cauſed his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to be numbred, and the people in great multitudes were ſlaine therefore. Or rather as Tutors vnto Princes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deale with their pupils, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fault, their ſeruants are beaten: but herein is the difference: there the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is beaten for the ſon, but here the ſon for the ſeruant: the naturall ſonne for the vnnaturall child: the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, for the adopted ſon: the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſon, for the ſonne by grace: the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, for his enemies. So Chriſt was puniſhed, and we are pardoned: Chriſt was charged with, and wee diſcharged from our ſins. For the Lord tooke him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14132:48"/> for the offendor, and puniſhed him as the offendor. It ſtandeth not therefore with Gods iuſtice, to puniſh thoſe our ſins in our ſelues, that he alreadie char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon his ſon, and our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. But the equity of this ſhal the better appeare, if we ſhall conſider, that our ſins are called and are indeed thoſe debts which wee ought vnto the Lord. For the payment whereof, Chriſt entred into bonds, with this condition therein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndorſed, that if we in any part failed, he of his owne ſubſtance would ſatisfie the whole. Now ſuch was our beggery, that we were not able to ſatisfie the ſame, &amp; ſuch was the wiſedome of God, that he would not ſeek by rigor of law to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the debt of vs poore men, the beſt &amp; richeſt of vs, being but beggarly mates, and therefore in no likely-hood able to make payment therof to his Maieſty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he troubled &amp; ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d vs neuer ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. The lord therfore ſeeing that it was but loſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bor, that was ſpent vpon vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his action in great wiſedome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, being fully as rich in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in graces &amp; righteouſnes as hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſelf, &amp; therfore euery way able to ſatisfie the whole; who accordingly of his owne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14132:49"/> ſubſtance, euen of the ſubſtance of his bodie and blood paid vnto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whatſoeuer in iuſtice either hee could demand, or we ought. We ought to die, he ſatisfied the ſame: we ought to haue born the heauie wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the father, he ſatisfied the ſame: we ought to haue ben caſt into hell, and he ſatisfied alſo the ſame, as we beleeue in our Creed: and generally whatſoeuer we ought, he fully contented and payd vnto the Lord, inſomuch, that the father himſelfe acknowledged, and confeſſed in thunder from heauen, that in him hee was well pleaſed, euen fully ſatisfied and contented. So that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father himſelfe, (ſolemnely made from the heauens by his owne mouth, in the hearing of many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who haue left the ſame for a matter of record, for our ſelues, our heirs, and all poſteritie) it plainely appeareth, that by Chriſt, he himſelfe is fully ſatisfied, contented, paid, and pleaſed: and wee therfore, and therby, are fully and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquitted and diſcharged, from the beginning of the world, vnto the end therof, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all whatſoeuer debt of ſin we ought vnto the Lord. And that euen in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14132:49"/> the iuſtice of the Lord, who cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that as debt of vs, which Chriſt hath ſo fully ſatisfied for vs: eſpecially, hauing for euer this general quittance, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Lords own finger, to ſhew for our full diſcharge. So that euen by law, we haue a diſcharge from law, and from all our offences, and ſinnes, which were thoſe debts, for the paiment wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto the Lord. So that the Lord cannot enter into iudgement with vs, nor by the rigour of the lawe, claime any debt at our hands. For with what iuſtice can the Lord demaund any debt at our hands, when Chriſt our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who ſtood bound for vs, hath by the Lords owne confeſſion, ſatisfied whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he could demaund, and hath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the hand writing that was againſt vs? So that how, or by what means would the Lord recouer any debt from vs? can bee ſue his band againſt vs? why he hath none, for it is cancelled. Or be it that he hath; why, yet we haue both the Lords own confeſſion recorded, and alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient witneſſes, yea, a generall quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in theſe words mentioned, and fully ſet downe, written by the Lords owne hand, for our full diſcharge. The

Thus then it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euen by the iuſtice of god, that our ſinnes are cleane blotted out, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

For Chriſt did not beare onely the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our ſinnes, but our ſins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo. According as <hi>Eſay</hi> beareth witneſſe in his 53 Chapter, where, hee ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, that hee bare our infirmities, and caried our griefes. And againe in the ſame place: My iuſt ſeruant, ſaith hee, ſhall iuſtifie many, whoſe ſins he hath taken vpon himſelfe. And again, he carying the ſins of many, made interceſſion for ſinners. For he is that true Goat mentioned in the 16 of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> vpon whome the ſinnes of all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14132:50"/> the people of God were put, verely and indeed: which therefore he carried with himſelfe, into the deſart into the hewen place, euen into the graue, or rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the croſſe: whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e hee faſtened them, aboliſhed, and crucified them, together with himſelfe, and ſo crucified our old man, and aboliſhed the verie bodie of ſinne. For he is the bodie, the goat was but the ſhadowe: he therefore had our ſins put vpon him, and bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e them with himſelfe, verely and indeed: euen as the Goat, who was but a type, or figure of Chriſt, bore them but ceremonially, &amp; in a ſhadow. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle &amp; ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, giuing, as it ſhould ſeeme, the true ſence hereof, is not afraide to ſay, that Chriſt himſelfe bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e our ſinnes in his owne bodie, vpon the tree. Whereby (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in his ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Corinthians, and the fift chap.) the Lord made Chriſt that knew no ſinne, to be ſin for vs: that he might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. So that hereby it plainely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that our ſinnes, and therefore, and thereby, our ſinfull perſon it ſelfe alſo, were verily and indeed, put vpon Chriſt.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14132:51"/> Whereby it came to paſſe, that he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, being ſtil, and euen then, the righteouſneſſe of God vnto vs: the vnſpotted and vndefiled lambe of God, in whoſe mouth there was no guile, and in whoſe heart no ſinne:) that he, I ſay, appeared before God, in our perſon, whoſe ſinnes he bore: and that as the monſtrouſnes of ſin it ſelfe, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was puniſhed, and condemned in him. And ſo ſin was condemned in the fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. For he that putteth vpon him other mens practiſes, putteth withall vpon himſelf other mens perſons: and he that taketh vpon him other actions, taketh withall vpon him another perſon. As plainly appeareth, both by our common &amp; vſuall phraſe of ſpeech, who vſe to ſay, that he that hath left his old ſinne, and taken vpon him a new life, that he is another manner of perſon, yea, and that he is not the ſame man: and alſo by the phraſe and vſe of the Scriptures, which cal the putting off of our ſinnes, the putting off of the old man, and the putting vpon vs of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and true holines, the putting on of the new man: (as <hi>Col.</hi> 3. verſ. 10.) the hid man of the hart: (as 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, verſ. 4.)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14132:51"/> yea Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, as in the 13 to the Romans, and laſt verſe.

So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it plainely appeareth, that the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of other actions, and practiſes, maketh vs to put on, and that verily, and indeed, in our owne ſenſible feeling, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons. Chriſt therefore putting vpon him other actions, I meane ſins; (not of his owne, for hee neuer did ſin, but of ours:) put therwith vpon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother perſon: and this perſon was our perſon, as thoſe ſinnes were our ſinnes, that he tooke vpon him.

Inſomuch, that it may be truly ſaid, that I, thou, the whole world, <hi>Salomon, Dauid, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, as he ſaith of himſelfe (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 20.) were (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our own perſons) crucified with Chriſt.

For this our old man being put vpon Chriſt; we the old men, or rather out perſon, (I ſpeake not after the fleſh, for we know no man after the fleſh, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) was alſo put vpon him.

Thou for thy whoredomes thefts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, falſe witneſſe, diſobedience to thy parents, euill luſts, and deſires, for thy blaſphemy, for thy idolatry, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Sabbath, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, and whatſoeuer ſinne els, haſt already in Chriſt been brought to open ſhame in the world, haſt been euill ſpoken of, rebuked, and reuiled, haſt ben made an open gaping and gazing ſtock to men, and Angells, thou haſt beene brought before rulers and Iudges, thou haſt been accuſed, whipped, skorned, condemned, and hanged, yea, vpon the tree of the croſſe. Thou haſt been in an agony, and ſweat water and bloud, thou haſt felt the wrath of God, and hell fire, thou haſt ben forſaken of God, and cried out therefore. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> thou haſt deſcended, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen gone downe into hell, and had the portion of the reprobate, and damned ſoule, thou haſt feet whatſoeuer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God in iuſtice could lay vpon thee.

So that euen by the iuſtice of God, which dooth not puniſh (I ſay not with two kinds of puniſhments) but not twiſe for one ſin, thou art for euer fully freed and diſcharged from all ſinnes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, whether in word, in worke, or in thought, whether of knowledge, or of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of weaknes, or of wilfulneſſe, thou haſt alreadie beene puniſhed for them in thine owne perſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore canſt not in God, iuſtice againe be condemned for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in that day I ſay, when the wrath of God ſhall bee reuealed from heauen vpon all vnrighteouſnes &amp; diſobedience of man.

And as this is true, that as we haue borne the Image of the earthly, ſo we ſhall beare the image of the heauenly: So this alſo is true, that as wee are partakers of the earthly ſap, and ſinne, ſo are wee alſo partakers of the heauenly ſeed, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes And as that which is borne of vnclean ſeed, no man can make cleane: ſo that which is borne of cleane ſeed, muſt needs be cleanſed from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as man that is conceiued in ſinne, and borne in iniquitie, muſt needs be full of iniquitie, and a ſinner: ſo man that is new borne of water, and the holy Ghoſt, muſt needs be waſhed, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all his ſinnes. For euen as the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14132:55"/> wild Oliue braunch, being grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the naturall Oliue tree, being made partaker of the fatnes, and nouriſhment the eof, is purged, and purified from his wild and bitter taſt and ſap: ſo wee being grafted into Chriſt the true vine, are made partakers of the heauenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; ſo purged from the guiltines of all our ſinnes and offences. And this reaſon is notably vrged by <hi>Paule</hi> in the fift to the Romanes, in theſe words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But not as is the offence, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died, much more the grace of God, &amp; the gift, which is by the grace of one man, euen Ieſus Chriſt, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded vnto many. Neither is that which entred by one ſinning, like vnto the gift: for the iudgement came by one vnto condemnation, but the gift of many offences, vnto iuſtification. For if by the ſinne of one man, death raigned by one, much more they which receiue the abundance of the grace and gift of righteouſnes, ſhal raigne in life, by one, euen by Ieſus Chriſt. As therfore by one ſin, ſinne came ouer all men vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: ſo by one righteouſneſſe, righteouſnes came vpon all, to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14132:56"/> of life. Therefore as by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of one man, many are made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one man many are made righteous. So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtles notably ſheweth vnto vs, how that Chriſt was as able to waſh vs, as <hi>Adam</hi> to defile vs, Chriſt as able to purge vs, as <hi>Adam</hi> to corrupt vs, Chriſt as able to take away death, and ſinne, as <hi>Adam</hi> was to b ing both, euen death, &amp; ſinne. If therfore this be granted, which before hath been proued, namely, that we were borne of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Iewes that crucified him, and put him, being the Lord of life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, beleeuing and being baptiſed into his name for the remiſſion of their ſins, were receiued to mercie: yea, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the croſſe, hee praied for his perſecutors, ſaying: Father, lay not this ſinne vnto their charge, for they know not what they doe. His diſciples would, as <hi>Elias,</hi> haue commaunded fire to come downe from heauen, and conſumed his enemies, but he reproued them, ſaying. Yee know not of what ſpirit you are. Such a one is Chriſt ſtill, hee hath

The heauens make him not more churliſh, which were rather helliſh than heauenly: but more kinde, and louing, to all that faithfully call vpon him. For we muſt not thinke the God of all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to be like vnto corrupt, &amp; prophane man, whom honor puffeth vp, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo much the more proude, and ſcornefull, by how much the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious he is: but we muſt rather take him &amp; meaſure him, by the fartheſt diſtance therefrom: euen by the cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie therevnto For therefore is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſt his life with men deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that we may know how hee liueth with God.

            <p n="3">3 Laſtly, this his mercie, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to forgiue vs, may the rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto vs, by the promiſes of mercie made vnto all thoſe that come vnto him. As namely, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And again, ſtanding in the temple, in the great day of the feaſt, he cried a loud ſaying; If any man thirſt, let him come to me, and I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him. And again to the woman of Samaria, if thou knoweſt who it were that ſaith vnto thee, giue me water, thou worldeſt haue asked of him, and hee would haue giuen vnto thee, waters of the well of life, of which, whoſoeuer drinketh, ſhall neuer hunger, nor thirſt more. So that by theſe promiſes of Chriſt both to giue, and to forgiue; to giue graces, and to forgiue our ſinnes; we are moſt fully reſolued in this point.

And that which all other phiſicke cannot doe vnto the bodie, this doth vnto the ſoule. For it cureth them that are loue ſick, euen ſick for the loue of women, gold, ſiluer, promotion &amp; of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: yea, it taketh away old, inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat, &amp; confirmed diſeaſes: though they haue ben continued ten, twenty, fortie, foureſcore, a hundred yeares: yea, our whole life: yea, it healeth naturall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and thoſe which were brought into the world, euen originall ſin, which we had from our fathers infection.</p>
            <p>And that which is more, we are borne blind, ſo that we could not behold the light of the glory of God, in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, and yet this maketh vs ſee: we were born deafe, ſo that our eares, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14132:67"/> we were dumb, that we could not ſpeak to the glorie of God, and this giueth vs ſpeech: we were born lame, ſo that we could not walk in the waies of the lord, &amp; this maketh vs whole: for the blood of Chriſt is as able to cure the lame legs of the ſoule, as the name of Chriſt in the Apoſtles ſpirite, was able to cure him that was a cripple borne, &amp; lay begging at the beautifull gate of the temple: the blood of Chriſt is as able to cure all the diſeaſes whatſoeuer of the ſoule, as the word of Chriſt was to cure all the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the bodie, whatſoeuer. And yet I know not how, we account not of this medicine: either becauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth baſe vnto vs, becauſe wee knowe not the ſtrength and vertue therof: or els becauſe wee neede it not. For as whole men care not for phiſicke, &amp; them that are ſound, account not of purgations, but caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the fire, or at their heels: ſo they that are luſty in ſoule, that think themſelues ſound as the Phariſie, that are not wounded at the hart, as the Iews in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> contemne the blood of Chriſt, &amp; make no reckoning thereof. But when they are once woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the feeling of their ſins, then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14132:68"/> they take it to the hart, that before they ſet at their heeles: and neuer doth man know the profit of this bloud, vntill hee haue ben ſick in mind. All other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of the body will not helpe ſome one diſeaſe thereof: but this being but one, helpeth all infirmities of the ſoule.

But now hauing this, it is a preſent remedie: whereas otherwiſe euery light word, and euery little fall, would haue killed bodie and ſoule: but ſuch is the force of the bloud of Chriſt, that hauing the ſame ready, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt poyſon of the ſerpent cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vs, the hotteſt firie dart burne vs, nor the greateſt wound kill vs: we are preſently whole, ſo ſoone as we apply it.

So that we may ſay, away death, thou art ouercom by death: away death, thou art ouercome by life: his weaknes is ouercom by his ſtrength: our infirmitie by his power: our ſinne by his righteouſnes: his death brought our life: he was weake, to ſtrengthen vs: he baſe, that we glorious: he ſicke, that wee ſound: hee a baniſhed man, that we Citizens: he fleſh, that we ſpirituall: he ſhed his blood, that we might be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnes: and therfore is it that the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:14132:71"/> 6.) that ye are waſhed, that ye are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that yee are ſanctified, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, and by the ſpirit of our God. So that they that ſorrow rightly for their ſinnes, and are poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of bondage to feare, euen to feare hell, Gods wrath, the deuill, and their owne eſtate, may be aſſured, that the ſame ſpirit that worketh the ſorrow, waſheth the ſoule: that breedeth the feare, bringeth the fauour of God: that defileth their cheeks with teares, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their ſoules from ſinne alſo: for one ſpirit worketh all, and in all the elect of God. So that while we lay open our ſins, we lay them vpon Chriſt, who beareth them, and taketh them away. While we hide not our ſins, the lord hideth them. He that ſorroweth rightly for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all ſorrow for them: and hee that rightly ſeeth them, looſeth the ſight of them for euermore.</p>

For if we ſay we haue no ſin, we deceiue our ſelues, and there is no truth in vs. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the euill which hee would not do, he doth. <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſed in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto the Lord, his owne ſins, and the ſinnes of the people. <hi>Noah,</hi> his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: <hi>Iobs</hi> curſing: <hi>Dauids</hi> adulterie: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> idolatrie: <hi>Peters</hi> apoſtacie: and <hi>Moſes</hi> infidelitie: are by the word, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted vnto the whole world. And brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what man is he that may not learne to pray, as Chriſt hath taught him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſses, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them that trespaſſe againſt vs.</hi> True it is, that many there be, who haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Paul,</hi> to haue the Meſſenger of Sathan cleane remoued: yea, and haue ſtriued to attaine vnto the power of the death, and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, and vnto the reſurrection of the dead: that euen in this life, they might be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fully from ſinne. But neuer could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul,</hi> as him ſelfe confeſſeth, or any other therefore, attaine therevnto. And no maruell: for nature may well be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but neuer by any labour cleane
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14132:73"/> rooted out. And therefore as the Cat of the mountain cannot change her ſpots, nor the Ethyopian his skin, ſith nature hath made them ſuch: ſo neither can man cleane put away his ſinne, ſith na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made him a ſinner. Which thing howſoeuer, it cannot excuſe the obſtinat, yet it may comfort the weake: knowing that the Lord wil be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily moued to pardon thoſe our ſinnes, which nature will we, nill we, inforceth vs to do. For when we ſinne, we do but our nature. And therefore in reaſon, we the rather are to be pardoned. For euen with reaſon, this is a good, and therfore a common reaſon, why me ſhould ſpare our brute beaſts, behauing themſelues more brutiſhly: alas, ſay we, let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, they do but their nature. And why ſhould it not ſeem vnto reaſon, as good reaſon, why the Lord (in regard of whome, man is not ſo much, as a brute beaſt is vnto a man) ſhould ſpare, &amp; not for merit, but for pitie pardon man, who when he ſinneth, doth nothing elſe but his nature: for his owne nature driueth him vnto ſin. This reaſon therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo good vnto the holy Ghoſt, and ſo comfortable vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14132:74"/> vſeth the ſame in his 103. pſalm, to ſhew, that as a father pitieth his owne children, ſo the Lord (as mercie reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth miſerie, ſo pitie reſpecteth frailtie) pitieth them that feare him. For, ſaith hee, the Lord knoweth our making, he remembreth that wee are but duſt, and that the daies of mortall man, are but as the graſſe, and that hee flouriſheth, but euen as the flower of the field, when the winde bloweth vpon it, it is no longer, neither is the place thereof knowne any more. This therefore is the firſt reaſon, taken from the conſideration of our ſelues, to whom being begotten in ſin, it is naturall to ſinne.</p>

Ad here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, how late it is ſince that wee were new borne, and (as babes) begotten by the immortall ſeede of the word: and this doctrine will ſhine as cleare as the ſun, at the noone day. For what though wee haue beene regenerate an hundred yeres ſince: is it in regard either of God, with whom a thouſand yeares are but as one day: or in regard of immortalitie, and that long aged life, that we, that are borne of the immortall ſeede of God, ſhall bee partakers of: is it, I ſay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereof, any more than yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?

For it ſerueth to the ſetting forth of the abundance of the grace of God: and to the magnifying of the power of the Lord. As plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth both by the teſtimonie of <hi>Paul:</hi> who ſaith, that where ſinne aboundeth, there grace aboundeth alſo:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14132:78"/> and alſo by the anſwere of the Lord made vnto <hi>Paule,</hi> who ſaid vnto him (praying, as himſelf teſtifieth three times that the meſſenger of Sathan, the prick of the fleſh, might be remooued away from him) my grace is ſufficient for thee. For by thy weakenes is my power made perfect: or, as ſome tranſlate it, made ſtrong. This anſwere of the Lord vnto <hi>Paule,</hi> I take to be ſpoken vnto all men, and ſo eſpecially vnto my ſelfe. For of a truth Lord, thy power is made ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g indeed by my weakenes. For now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (indued, though with ſome good gifts) ouercome by Sathan, do know the power of the ſpirit that dwelt in thee, to bee perfect, and powerfull, that neuer could be ouercome by Sathans aſſault. Thus is thy power made perfect by my weaknes, by compariſon. Again, O Lord when I am ouercome, I feele the power of thy death, to ouercome Sathan, hell, and condemnation: and of a weake man to ſtrengthen me ſo, that thy power is made ſtrong by thy victory. For the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Sathan, and of my ſinnes, cannot ouercom the power of thy death which is Sathans death, and of power againſt him. Againe my God, I being weak, do
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14132:78"/> ſometimes couercome, when before I was ouercom: by whoſe power was this but by thy power? which is ſo much the greater, by how much I am the weaker. For Sathan is wonderfull ſtrong, and I wonderfull weake. How then could I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome him being wonderfull ſtrong, except thy ſtrength were wonderfull in me, being wonderfull weak? Oh Chriſt be ſtrong in me, for I am weak. Thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer O Chriſt, is the greater, &amp; thy grace ſo much the more abundant, by how much my ſins are the greater, that thou pardoneſt. To pardon ſmall ſins, is great grace: but to pardon many ſinnes, and thoſe monſtrous alſo, magnifieth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of thy grace to me ward: and not onely vnto me, but it commendeth the excellency thereof, to all that taſt thereof. Lord, I ſpeake not theſe things to make them a cloke for my ſinne, but a comfort to my ſoule: nothing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g but that I doing that, which it is thy will I ſhould do, and that for the glorie of thy grace, and the perfecting of thy power, ſhal eaſily obtian pardon for the ſame: yea, though it be ſinne that I doe.

And alſo by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes, in the ſecond of the Acts: who being wounded in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14132:82"/> came to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſaying; <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhal we do?</hi> For the Miniſters are the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions &amp; Surgeons of the ſoule, to heale the ſame, as well as they are the Lords warriors, and ſo by the force of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall weapons, of power to caſt down e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie high hold, euerie ſtrong thought, and euerie name that is exalted againſt the name of God and Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore, as by the armour of God on the left hand, they can wound thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: ſo by the armor of God on the right hand, they can wound the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemy. As by the law, they can kill thee; ſo by the Goſpel they can quicken thee: as by the one they caſt thee down: ſo by the other they can lift thee vp. For they are the diſpenſers of the manifold graces of God, and the Lords ſtewards, to giue to euerie one his portion in due time. Iudgement, to whom iudgment appertaineth, and mercie vnto thee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome mercie belongeth. So that if thou repaire to them for comfort, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f they ſhal giue thee comfort, thou maiſt be comforted indeed. If they ſhall giue thee thy portion, in the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, they giue vnto thee, as vnto the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14132:82"/> Lords ſeruant, that thy portion therein which is due vnto thee. If they ſhall ſay vnto thee, that thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee, it is all one, as if the Lord himſelfe had ſaid ſo much vnto thee. For they are the Lords ſeruants, not onely as other men, to doe their maiſters will, but his meſſage alſo: not onely to ſerue him in doing, but with going alſo: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come when they are called, but to runne when they are ſent. For they are as it were the Lords footmen, which are ſent by him to doe his meſſage, and to ſignifie his minde vnto thee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that the Apoſtle asketh in the tenth to the Romanes, how they ſhall heare without a Preacher, and how they ſhall preach except they be ſent? So that when the Miniſter commeth vnto thee, to comfort thee, &amp; to aſſure thee of the forgiuenes of thy ſins, thou muſt know for a certaintie, that he is ſent vnto thee by the Lord, to do this his meſſage vnto thee, &amp; to tell thee, euen from the Lords owne mouth, that thy ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee. And this thou maieſt and muſt aſſure thy ſelfe of, whether he come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, either voluntarie without thy procurement (as <hi>Nathan</hi> did vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:14132:83"/> who ſaid vnto him (hearing the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſin) and the Lord hath taken away thy ſinne, that thou ſhalt not die for it: and as Chriſt came voluntarily vnto the Iewes, without their ſending for him, the ſpirit of God hauing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him, and ſent him to preach the glad tidings of the Goſpel, euen vnto ſo many as were a far off:) or whether hee come vnto thee, being ſent for by thee, as <hi>Peter</hi> was by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who although hee came vnto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> being ſent for by him, yet both was <hi>Peter</hi> by the viſion which hee ſaw, warned by God himſelfe to goe: &amp; alſo <hi>Cornelius</hi> commanded to ſend for him, by an Angell: but thou by the ſpirit. And therefore when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter commeth vnto thee to tell thee that thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee, aſſure thy ſelfe as the truth is in Chriſt Ieſus, that whether hee come by thy procurement, or without thy procureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he was ſent to thee by the Lord, to ſignifie ſo much of his gracious pleaſure vnto thee. For euerie faithfull Miniſter is the ſeruant of the Lord, ſent from the Lord himſelfe to doe his meſſage: yea, he is the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of the Lord. For as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. we are Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14132:83"/> for you. As therefore the embaſſador repreſenteth the perſon of the Lord his king that ſent him: ſo doth the Miniſter of the goſpel being the Lords embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, repreſent the perſon of the Lord, &amp; his Prince Chriſt Ieſus: and ſo ought to be taken, euen as an earthly embaſſador is, with the kings &amp; princes of the world. As therefore this is true, which <hi>Paule</hi> in the fore-mentioned place ſaith, namely, that wee come as Embaſſadours in the name of Chriſt, as though God himſelf intreated you by vs, ſo we intreat you in the name of Chriſt to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: So likewiſe this is true, namely, that wee come as Embaſſadours in the name of Chriſt, as though God himſelf ſpake vnto you: ſo wee ſay vnto you in the name of Chriſt, that your ſins are forgiuen you. And therefore when thou ſeeſt the embaſſador of the Lord, which is his Miniſter, come vnto thee, and tell thee, that thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee, think with thy ſelfe, that the Lord as it were by his owne mouth, hath now told thee, that he hath pardoned thine offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Yea the Miniſters of the lord are the Angels of the Lord, and ſo are called in the third of <hi>Malachy,</hi> and the firſt verſe:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14132:84"/> in the ſecond and third of the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; in diuers other places. For there <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> the forerunner of Chriſt, is called the Angell of God: &amp; againe, the Miniſter of Epheſus, of Philadelphia, of Smyrna, of Pargama, is called the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, Philadelphia, Smyrna, Pargama, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd ſo forth: to teach vs, that ſo we ſhould account of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, as of the Angels of God: and of their meſſage in the name of Chriſt, as if an Angell of glorie from heauen, ſhould haue told vs the ſame. Now if an Angel ſhould haue ſpoken to thee, as he did vnto <hi>Manoah,</hi> or vnto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the mother of Chriſt, at his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or vnto <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> at his graue, or the Diſciples at his aſcention, or vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation, or as vnto Chriſt in his agonie, thou wouldeſt I hope be ſatisfied and comforted therewith. And why then art thou not aſwell certified by the teſtimonie of the Miniſters, which are in like manner (as thou knoweſt) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel the Angels of god, as they: although indeed herein they differ: the one is an heauenly, the other an earthly: the one a more glor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is taken from the teſtimonie of the deuill: who very ſufficientlie in his naturall language, if we rightly vnderſtand the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth vnto vs the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes. And therefore for the better vnderſtanding of his ſpeech, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I will ſet thee down but two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts &amp; rules, as it were characters, by the which thou ſhalt eaſily vnderſtand the darkeſt and hardeſt words in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils toong: and ſo ſhalt in ſhort ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good languager. The firſt rule ſhall ſhew thee when he ſpeaketh: the ſecond what he ſpeaketh. Concerning the firſt, know for a certain, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou receiueſt any anſwer in thy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14132:87"/> conſcience, contrarie to that which is promiſed, or ſpoken in the word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the forgiuenes of thy ſin, to the receiuing of the ſpirit of adoption, to the increaſe of the graces of the holy Ghoſt, to the attaining of the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Saints in light, or the poſſeſſion of eternal life, or any ſuch like, that then the deuill tempteth thee: and ſpeaketh that word, and maketh that anſwere in thy ſoule. For this perſwaſion, and this anſwer, and this word, that the Lord wil not forgiue thy ſin, or giue thee his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or eternal life, &amp; ſaluation, commeth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. For the word of God ſaith the cleane contrarie. And we know that the Lord ſpeaketh not one thing in his word, and another thing in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; one thing in his ſcriptures, &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in thy ſoule. Learne therfore this for a true and an infallible precept, that whenſoeuer thou receiueſt an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in thy ſelf, contrary to that which the Lord hath promiſed, that then the deuill ſpeaketh: &amp; this thou muſt know to be true, althogh the perſwaſion come from thine owne concupiſcence, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. For the Apoſtle calleth the prick of the fleſh, which is the motion,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14132:88"/> and worke of original ſinne, the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Sathan (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) This then is the firſt precept, by which thou maieſt know when he ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>The ſecond rule, which muſt make thee vnderſtand his wordes, muſt make thee firſt vnderſtand his nature, which is to lie. For it is naturall for the deuill to lie. For he is naturally a lyer: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by the teſtimonie of Chriſt in the eight of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e he ſaith, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth. There is no truth in him, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times as he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own, becauſe he is a lier, and the father of a lie: and alſo, by the practiſe of the deuil himſelf, who both lied to our mother <hi>Eue,</hi> ſaying: that if ſhee did eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, that ſhee ſhuld be like vnto the gods, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill, and that they ſhould not die: and alſo was a lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the mouth of the Prophets of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab,</hi> and ſo deceiued <hi>Achab,</hi> and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Out of this knowledge of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils lying nature, thou ſhalt preſently picke the meaning of his ſpeeches, and words. For this rule is generally true,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14132:88"/> that a lier ſpeaketh clean contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth: and the cleane contrarie of that which the deuil ſpeaketh, is true. For in a lier, the cleane contrarie part muſt be taken for the truth. If therefore it euer hath beene ſaid vnto thee in thy ſoule, that thou ſhouldeſt not bee ſaued, or that thy ſinnes ſhould not be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it hath beene as it were the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Lord vnto thy ſoule, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto thee, thy election, and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that thou ſhouldeſt be ſaued, and that thy ſins were forgiuen. And looke how often this hath beene vrged vnto thy ſoule: ſo often hath it been told vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee by the Lord, although by the meſſage of the deuil, if thou hadſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood his language. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when thou, fearing the forgiuenes of thy ſinnes, receiueſt an anſwer in thy ſoule, that in vaine thou prayeſt, &amp; that thou ſhalt not be pardoned, becauſe thy ſins are greater, as thou art perſwaded then that they can be forgiuen: ſo often cheare thy ſelfe, and thanke God for his louing mercie, and meſſage, that hath told thee, and certified thy conſcience, though by the meſſage of Sathan, that thy ſins are forgiuen thee. For alwaies
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14132:89"/> that which is cleane contrarie vnto the ſpeech of a lier, is the truth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Sathan ſaith, that they are not forgiuen: the cleane contrarie is true: and that is, that they are forgiuen. If we haue once learned this leſſon well, and ſhall put the ſame in practiſe in our ſoules, and conſciences: we ſhall find as much comfort in this reaſon, (I know what I ſpeake) as in any other reaſon whatſoeuer. For her by the mouth of the deuill is ſtopped for euer, and he goeth away raging, not knowing what elſe to ſay. For if he did flatter vs with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our ſinnes, we would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his teſtimonie: as <hi>Paul</hi> would not receiue the teſtimony of the ſouthſaier, or Chriſt of the deuill, that confeſſed him to bee the ſonne of the liuing God: but we would beleeue that to be true, becauſe the Lord in his word ſaid it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if he did terrifie the conſcience, &amp; denie the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, we would beleeue it then moſt ſtronglie, knowing that, in that a lier did denie it, the truth it ſelfe did affirm it. Thus eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way Sathan ſhould be taken in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma: what argument ſoeuer he vſed, it would be turned vpon his owne head:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14132:89"/> and we ſhould be more wiſe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell was ſubtile: we ſhould haue better skill in the truth of Logicke, or reaſon, than he in Sophiſtry. If he did flatter vs, we would cheare vpon it: if he did feare vs we would cheare alſo vpon it: if hee did perſwade the forgiuenes of our ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oue the forgiuenes of ſins, which is drawne from the euill and daungerous counſell of Sathan.</head>
            <p>THe laſt reaſon that wee will at this time conſider, is taken from that diuelliſh and daungerous counſell, which Sathan giueth to the ſoule: which beeing troubled with the weight of ſinne, deſireth the forgiueneſſe thereof. For it is the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14132:90"/> faſhion of Sathan, when thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to perſwade thee to kill thy ſelfe, to hang thy ſelfe, to drowne thy ſelfe, or at the leaſt to caſt off al confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in hope, all vſe of faith, and fully to diſpaire of the mercy of God. Then the which what counſel can be more diueliſh for Sathan to giue? or more dangerous for thee to follow? For diſpaire is a ſin of the firſt table, againſt the firſt commandement, and againſt the higheſt God And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſtion, it is the higheſt and greateſt ſin of all other (that great ſin only, which is the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, excepted.) It is therefore a worſer, and a greater ſinne to diſpaire, then it is to worſhip Idols, to prophane the Saboth, to blaſpheme the name of the Lord, to diſhonor thy parents, to kil thy father, or thy brother to deflour thy neighbors daughter, or wife, to rob thy neighbor, to beare falſe witneſſe, and to forſweare thy ſelfe, or then it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other ſuch like ſinne.

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s. And the fore if according vnto the counſell of the deuill, thou ſhouldeſt ad diſpaire to thy other ſins: to thy whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, thy murder, thy blaſphemie, or thy robberie, thou ſhouldeſt draw ſinne after ſin as it were with cartropes: adde drunkennes vnto thirſt, and ſo heaping vp of thy ſins, ſhouldeſt fulfill the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thine iniquitie, and purchaſe to thy ſelfe ſwift damnation Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how thou follow this counſell of the deuill who, as in all other ſpeeches he ſheweth himſelfe moſt znfaithfull: ſo in this his perſwaſion to dtſpaire, moſt, I know not whether I ſhall call him dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or doltiſh. For to perſwade to diſpaire after ſinne, to commit one ſin after another, the greater after the leſſer: is as much, as if an vnfaithfull phiſition ſhould preſcribe a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14132:91"/> thee. For when thou haſt committed a great ſinne againſt God, he would haue thee commit a greater: to driue away the fear of death, he preſcribeth the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die death of bodie and ſoule: to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the feare of hell fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe for thee to follow: yea although thou canſt hate other ſins, and crie out againſt the lothſomnes therof yet thou canſt be ready to giue place to diſpaire, which is the greateſt ſin, and to like that wel enogh to nouriſh it, &amp; to think that thou mighteſt do well to diſpaire, and to caſt off al hope of gods mercie. Is it not a ſtrange thing, that thou ſhouldſt loth whoredome, theft, murder, and ſuch like ſins: yea, and if thou wert but mooued to them, he greeued therat, and yet like
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14132:91"/> of diſpaire, a ſinne farre greater than all the reſt? yea, and that thou being but moued therevnto, ſhouldeſt giue place vnto it immediately? If therefore other ſinnes be loathſome vnto thee, for the monſtrouſnes thereof: let diſpaire, which is the moſt monſtrous ſinne of al other, be moſt lothſome vnto thee. If thou fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and flieſt other ſinnes: feare, and flie eſpecially diſpaire: which is a ſinne farre greater than they all. And if thou hauing committed adultery, murder, or theft, or any ſuch like, art by Sathan tempted to diſpaire, anſwere him, and ſay thus vnto him: Sathan, thou haſt tempted me to commit this ſin, thou haſt tempted me to lie, to diſſemble, to commit adultrie, and ſuch like: herein I haue yeelded to thee. Is it not enough, nay, is it not too much, that I haue thus farre yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, except I ſhould now ad diſpaire vnto the reſt of my ſins? If it were now in my hand to vndo that ſinne which I haue committed, I would neuer ſurely by the power of the lord, yeeld ſo much vnto thee as I haue done. And therfore farre be it from me, that I ſhould again at thy procurement ſin more greeuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in falling to diſpaire, of the grace and

               </gap>e, to thy fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie darts that ſticke in my ſoule, I were bewitched, and worſe then mad, if I would yeeld thervnto. Thus thou muſt learne to ſtop Sathans mouth, and to ſtay thine owne faith, that it fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſpaire: of which I would haue thee to be moſt iealous, fearefull, and ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, knowing the daunger, and vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable euill thereof. If thou haue rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed God of his glorie, in diſhonoring of him: yet giue glorie vnto him in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of him: ſo ſhalt thou get as much glory to his name, by beleeuing him: as thou diddeſt rob him of, by diſobeying him: and purchaſe as great, nay, a faire more excellent righteouſnes by faith,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14132:92"/> then thou diddeſt looſe by ſinne. For as <hi>Paule</hi> teſtifieth in the fourth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to him that worketh not, but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him, that iuſtifieth the wicked, his faith is imputed, &amp; accounted to him for righteouſneſſe. And this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, is, as in another place the Apoſtle teſtifieth, the righteouſneſſe of God: which is farre more excellent than the righteouſnes of man. And this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes perchance thou wouldeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue ſought for, if thou haddeſt not ſeene thy ſelfe naked, and deſtitute of all righteouſneſſe in thy ſelfe: and couered ſo ouer with the ſhame of thine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, &amp; filthines, that thou wert glad to runne vnto Chriſt, for his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to couer thee: and buy of him eie-ſalue, and white garments, that thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes might not be ſeene. If therefore thou haſt loſt righteouſneſſe, yet keepe faith: if thou haue loſt the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, yet keepe the ſhield of faith, whereby thou mayeſt quench all the fierie darts of the deuill. If thou haue loſt the armour of light, the cloth of my ſoule, yet defend and keepe faith, which is the life of the ſoule; for the iuſt ſhall liue by faith.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14132:95"/> the peace of conſcience: hee lifted the light of his countenance vpon thee, and reuealed vnto thee himſelfe, &amp; his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. Theſe benefits (will he ſay) as thou knoweſt, ſhould haue mooued thee vnto repentance: but thou, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hardneſſe of thine own hart, that cannot repent, haſt ſinned againſt the Lord: and ſo heaped and hoorded vp wrath againſt the day of wrath, &amp; the reuelation of the iuſt iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God. Indeed (will he ſay) if thou hadſt neuer receiued theſe graces from God, then had there been left vnto thee ſome more hope: but now, after thou haſt receiued all theſe graces, to fall away, to quench the ſpirit, and grieue the holy Ghoſt, whereby thou wert ſealed vnto the day of redemption: is ſuch a ſinne as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pardoned. And to this purpoſe he will alledge the ſaying of the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes, in the ſixt Chapter, where hee ſaith, that it is impoſſible that they which haue been once enlightened, and haue taſted the heauenly gift, and been partaker of the holy Ghoſt, and haue taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to be renewed by repentance. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14132:95"/> by this meanes, and teſtimonie of the ſpirit of God, hee exceedingly terrifieth the conſcience: and will neuer ſuffer it to haue peace, vntill it ſhall pleaſe the Lord, to giue thereunto the right vſe, &amp; ſenſe of this place: wherwith Sathan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repulſed, aſſaulteth them afreſh, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from the former mercie of God, to the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, after this manner: ſaying, thou haddeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before in the like maner, and in the ſame matter, and that not once or twiſe, but oftentimes, and the Lord pardoned thee: and now doeſt thou think that he will pardon thee againe? Why art thou not aſhamed to come againe vnto the Lord, and craue pardon for this ſinne? With what face (will hee ſay) canſt thou look vpon the Lord? Why me thinketh, that thou ſhouldeſt be aſhamed to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Lord ſo often, with thy prayers and requeſts. Indeed (will he ſay) if it had been the firſt, or ſecond time, then it had beene more tollerable: but now, after the fift, or ſixt time, or more, again to trouble the Lord with thy requeſts, it is neither for thy honeſtie, nor for the Lords eaſe, to be troubled ſo often, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one matter: and by this means he

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14132:96"/> to fal into the hands of the liuing Lord: and that no adulterer, fornicator, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſon, murderer, or ſuch like, ſhall enter into the kingdome of God, or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but ſhall haue his portion in that lake that burneth with fire &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond death: as the ſpirit teſtifieth. And the more deeply to perſwade this vnto the conſcience: hee will ſet before vs the ſon of Gods loue, Ieſus Chriſt, and tell vs, that the Lord ſpared no not his owne ſonne, who had put our ſinnes vpon him: and how then ſhall he ſpare vs? yea, he will ſet before our eies the wrath of God poured vpon <hi>Cain,</hi> for his murder; vpon the Beniami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, for their adulterie; vpon <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> for their rebellion; who went downe quicke into hell: and vpon the Sodomits, whom the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with fire and brimſtone, from heauen, for their ſinne: yea, he will ſet before our eies the threatnings of God, who hath threatned death, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to all that ſhal tranſgreſſe his laws: and thoſe curſes contained in the law of God, denounced againſt the wicked. And as they which are in ſecuritie ſhall hear fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sathan, nothing els but mercy,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14132:97"/> mercie: ſo they that are afflicted, ſhall find nothing from Sathan, but iuſtice, iuſtice, wrath, vengeance, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And by this means, it is incredible what feare and trembling he breedeth in the hearts of the mourners: and by that means, how hardly they are broght that hear nothing, ſee nothing, feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but Gods iuſtice, to imbrace, and beleeue his mercie. And by this reaſon, he continually terrifieth the conſcience, vntill it knowe, that both the wrath of God was appeaſed in Chriſt Ieſus, who in our perſon, and for our ſin, was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſo the iuſtice of God was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, in, and vpon him: and alſo, that as the law, with the threatnings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, appertaineth vnto the obſtinate: ſo the promiſes, with the grace of God, &amp; not the lawe, appertaine vnto them that are trulie humbled, and in Ieſus Chriſt. For they that are in Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, are not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace. Now if Sathan ſee, that none of theſe reaſons from the Father, will ſerue his turne, hee will run with vs vnto Chriſt, and will tell vs, that there was neuer any ſuch man as Chriſt was: or if there were, that he was but a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

But if this will not ſerue the turn; he will perſwade vs that Chriſt came to be a iudge, to condemne the world, and to leaue them without excuſe; as he did <hi>Martine Luther:</hi> and ſo will he ſet him frowning vpon vs, as a Iudge, that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with vs. Or if this will not ſerue; hee will tell vs, that Chriſt came not to die for vs, but for <hi>Peter, Paule, Dauid,</hi> and ſuch like: but as for vs, hee knew vs not, we were not then: and therfore he could not then die for vs. But yet, if this will not ſuffice, hee will euen chide with the ſoule, and ask him whether hee will make Chriſt a bawd for his ſinnes. And this eſpecially he vrgeth, while wee ſeeing our own nakednes, do ſeeke and ſue for the righteouſnes of Chriſt to put vpon vs, as a white garment to couer vs: ſo as our nakedneſſe, &amp; the filthineſſe of our ſins be not ſeene. For then hee will ſtil vrge this one thing, ſaying: Oh thou wouldeſt haue Chriſt to be a couer, a cloake, yea, a bawd for thy ſin: but all in vaine, will he ſay. And for the proofe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14132:98"/> hereof, he wil ſtraight alledge the ſaying of the Lord in the 70. pſalme, which is to be applied to the obſtinate, and ſuch as hate diſcipline, and caſt the wordes of God behind their back, as there plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth: where he ſaith.

               </gap> as thou ſeeſt a theefe, thou conſenteſt vnto him, and thy portion is with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers. Thou openeſt thy mouth to euill, and with thy toong thou frameſt deceit. Thou ſitting, ſpeakeſt againſt thy brother, &amp; ſlaundereſt thy mothers ſon. While thou didſt theſe things, becauſe I made my ſelfe as it were deafe: thou thinkeſt me to be ſuch a one as thy ſelfe is: but I will reproue thee, and ſet before thine eies thy ſins in order as they were done. And herby he excedingly trobleth the conſcience, and filleth it with feare, and diſpaire, vntill ſuch time as we feele our ſelues verely and indeed, to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer with the righteouſnes of the ſon of God, Ieſus Chriſt, who is made vnto vs of God the Father, wiſedom, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, righteouſnes, and redemption. If this reaſon will not preuaile againſt vs, he wil reaſon as wel as we, from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: and will tell vs, that the feare that is bredde in our conſcience for our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14132:98"/> ſinnes, is not the worke of the ſpirit of God, to frame vs vnto repentance, and to breed in vs a godly ſorow, to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life: but rather, that it is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile fear, ſuch as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils; who fear, &amp; tremble: yea, a doubting ſuch as is in the infidels: of whome the ſame <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying; Let not the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that doubteth, think he ſhal receiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> any thing: yea, that it is a fore-taſt of the diſpleaſure of God, and of the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate of the reprobat. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the peace of conſcience, albeit we haue aboundantly felt the ſame, yet hee wil perſwade vs, that it was not the peace of conſcience, but rather an illuſion of the deuill, ſent vnto him by the Lord to deceiue him, and ſo to deſtroy him by a falſe flattering of himſelfe. And for the better perſwaſion hereof, he will tell vs, that the diuell can change himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the image of an Angell of light, and by that meanes ſo deceiue vs, as that we cannot, as he will ſay, diſcerne the worke of the ſpirit, from the illuſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14132:99"/> for that he cannot create, either ioy, or peace of conſcience. or the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vs. For theſe are proper works of the ſpirit: yea, euen in them that haue a temporarie faith, and fall away againe vnto perdition, his mouth is ſtopped, &amp; he will leaue this reaſon, and come vnto our naturall inclination to ſin, &amp; from thence he will reaſon after this manner, ſaying: Thou knoweſt that the Lord wil forgiue the ſinnes only of the penitent and them that doe repent: that leaue their ſinnes, and neuer commit them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: for that (will he ſay) is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But thou ceaſeſt not to ſinne: for as thou wert conceiued in ſinne, ſo thou continueſt in ſin: and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in thy ſin, how doeſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee of thy ſinne? and then, thou not repenting thee of thy ſinne, how canſt thou looke that thy ſinne ſhould be pardoned? And thus by a falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that repentance conſiſteth in a cleane aboliſhing of ſinne, and not in the amendment of life, as the truth is that it doth: hee deceiueth the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and perſwadeth it, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſinnes are not pardoned, becauſe they are not for euer abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14132:99"/> And vnto this perſwaſion, he addeth diuers other reaſons taken from ſinne it ſelfe: and firſt, from the greatnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which hee amplifieth and increaſeth very artificially, ſhewing himſelfe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Grammarian, that can frame of the poſitiue, which is the loweſt, the ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, which is the higheſt degree: a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritian, that hath a notable facilitie &amp; grace in <hi>Hyperbole:</hi> a Logitian, that can reaſon from the leſſer, to the greater: as alſo, if occaſion ſerued, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greater, to the leſſer: an Arithmetitian, that hath skill in multiplying: a Muſitian, that can make the loweſt cord, accord, and ſound equallie w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For theſe are the arts, or rather deceits of Sathan: whereby hee can notably increaſe the greatnes of our ſin. If it be but in conſent, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs, that it is all one, as if it were done. And to this purpoſe, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſaying of Chriſt, in the fift of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where he ſaith that the that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14132:100"/> on a woman to luſt after her in his hart, hath committed adultery with her alreadie. If it be committed after grace receiued, &amp; of knowledge: he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs that it is the ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which ſhall neuer bee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this world, nor in the world to come. If it were committed before our calling, &amp; groſſe alſo, he wil tell vs that our ſins are greater, then that they can be pardoned: as he perſwaded <hi>Cain</hi> that his were. And for the better perſwaſion hereof, he addeth the teſtimonie of the law, which confirmeth, as he pretendeth, that which he himſelfe affirmeth. As for example: if a man haue with <hi>Salomon</hi> committed idolatry, or with <hi>Dauid</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, or with <hi>Peter</hi> apoſtacie: here the law ſaith, that adulterers, idolaters, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, &amp; ſuch like, the lord wil iudge: Sathan ſaith ſo: the conſcience knoweth ſo. The law ſaith, no idolater, nor fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor vnclean perſon, ſhall enter into the kingdome of God, or Chriſt: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſaith ſo: the conſcience ſaith ſo. The law ſaith, the Lord hateth ſuch: the deuil ſaith, the Lord hateth ſuch: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciece feareth, that the Lord hateth ſuch: and it knoweth it ſelfe to bee ſuch. So
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14132:100"/> that Sathan affirming, the lawe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the conſcience conſenting ſinne is made out of meaſure ſinfull, by the law, and the art of Sathan. and ſo it ſeemeth to be ſo great, &amp; immeaſurable, as that it exceedeth the greatnes of the mercie of God, &amp; the value of the bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And yet further, the more to increaſe the greatnes of our ſin: he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to weigh the weight therof, which we feel ſenſibly to lie verie heauy on our ſouls, after we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the ſame. And therefore is it, that <hi>Dauid</hi> counteth him happy, that is lighted of his ſin: and Chriſt willeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are heauie laden to come vnto him, &amp; he will caſe them.

Vnto this weight of ſin, he addeth the monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that is in the ſame. For as righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is a moſt glorious vertue: ſo is ſinne a moſt vglie, deformed, and monſtrous thing; and ſo as it is, Sathan maketh it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14132:101"/> appeare to the ſoule. For howſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Sathan inticeth vs to ſin, wee are blinded, that we cannot behold the monſtrouſnes thereof, becauſe he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ouer with a pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cloake; yet after that the fact is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he openeth our eyes: to that the flithines and monſtrouſnes thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth at large vnto the ſoule.

So the ſoule eaſilie is reſolued thereof: and that ſo much the rather, becauſe it is an eie wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that which Sathan ſaith. And yet the more to increaſe the horror and greatnes of our ſins: he addeth the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude therof: which are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, than either the haires of our head, or the ſtarres of the skie, or the ſands of the ſea ſhore, which are innumerable: &amp; that therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecompenced in the multitude: and that which wanted in the weight, is repaired
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14132:101"/> with the number: wherby our ſins haue ben ſo exceedingly multiplied: as that what with the greatnes, and what with the multitude, our meaſure of iniquitie is fulfilled, our viall full, and the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and hoord of our ſinnes, filled to the top: &amp; that therefore the wrath of God muſt needs immediatly ſmoke againſt vs. And thus, partly by the law, partly by the weight, partly by the monſtrouſnes, and partly by the multitude of our ſins: he by this his art ſo increaſeth our ſins, that he decreaſeth our faith: and maketh them to be ſo great, that our faith is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or none at all: he ſo filleth our Lord with ſins, that hee emptieth the heart of hope: and maketh vs readie to thinke indeed with <hi>Cain,</hi> that our ſins are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that they can be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus, as Sathan reaſoneth from ſin in the firſt place, from the greatnes thereof, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the forgiuenes thereof: ſo in the ſecond place he reaſoneth from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence therof, which by the force &amp; work of Sathan, euen after the forgiueneſſe therof, and the peace of conſcience, and the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt giuen vnto the ſoule, is put in the memorie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto the ſoule: and that in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14132:102"/> ſuch a liuely ſhape, idea, and forme, as they are, and were in their owne nature. And this made <hi>Dauid</hi> complaine in his 51. pſalm, that his ſins were continually, before his eies: yea, after that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nathan</hi> hath told him, that his ſins were taken away, and that he ſhould not die therefore. And this made the ſame Prophet count him happie, whoſe ſins were couered (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32) namely, that they were no longer preſent before the eie of his conſcience, as well as the eies of the lord And this is that, that maketh the godly, at the hour of their death, or the day of their triall, to doubt, to feare, and to tremble, becauſe they ſee their ſins ſtil before their face &amp; freſh in their conſcience: which of it ſelf were enough to make them doubt of the forgiuenes of their ſins. How much more? when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſhal reaſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, and perſwade them, that therefore their ſinnes are not done away: ſith they are ſtill as freſh in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, as if they were but now done: that therefore they are not blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, ſith they are imprinted in their conſciences: that they are not defaced, ſith they are before their face: and that they are not taken out of their ſoul, ſith
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14132:102"/> they are ſtill therin. And wheras before they were couered, he will tell vs, that that was but with forgetfulnes or with ſecuritie, or hardnes of hart, or pleaſure, or ſome other fancies, that crept into the ſoule, in ſtead the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>of. But now when theſe things were gone, he might ſee, as Sathan will ſay, that the guiltines of his ſin, ſtill guilded ouer his conſcience: and the deformitie, and filthines therof, was but ſtubbered ouer with vntempered morter: and not waſhed cleane out, by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and the ſpirit of our God.
